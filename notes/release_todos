When ready to do a release, do the following:

1. conf.h - update version number and copyright eg current year
2. Changelog - list changes
3. debian/changelog - list changes
4. debian/copyright - update copyright dates as required eg current year
5. docs/source/conf.py - update copyright notice eg current year, version and release numbers
6. "cd docs" then "make man". Copy resulting docs/build/man/nodogsplash.1 to overwrite old debian/doc/nodogsplash.1
7. remove /docs/build directory created in step 6
8. Push to origin
9. Github - Create Pull Request and Merge to master
10. Github proceed to "Draft New Release"
11. Github tag release as eg. v3.3.0 (remembering the leading "v"") (or use git tag -a v3.3.0 -m "nodogsplash release 3.3.0 " and git push --tags.)
12. In your local repository, make a new branch called "stable"
13. Push branch "stable" to origin, overwriting the existing "stable". Branch stable is the source for the readthedocs stable documentation at https://nodogsplashdocs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
